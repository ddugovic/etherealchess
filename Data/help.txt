Frame-rate too low? 
Turn off antialiasing and reflections, disable the background, and use the native chess set.

How do I use a custom engine?
Copy the executable file of the UCI engine into the Data/Engines folder, and name it "Custom.exe", then you must set the AI engine to custom in the game options menu. A restart is required to change the AI engine. 

Note:
Checkmate isn't always detected properly, but you should be able to know since you can't move at all when it says check.
